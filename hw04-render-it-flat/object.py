# Defines a class called "object" that contains a method for reading an 
# Alias/Wavefront .obj files and storing them as a collection of faces.
#
#   vertex: a corner of a faceted surface.  It has a 3D position 
#           and participates in faces.
#
#   face: a triangular face on a surface of some object in the 
#         scene.  It has three vertices ordered in counter-
#         clockwise fashion.
#
#   edge: a border of a face and/or the meeting of two hinged
#         faces on the surface.
#
# Also contains a class method 'object.toPS' for rendering that object, 
# using perspective projection (and occlusion checking with ray-casting),
# as a Postscript file.
#
# That rendering is prescribed by a 'camera' object whose attributes 
# describe a perspective projection.
